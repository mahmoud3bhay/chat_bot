# chat_bot
I have created simple chat bot using deep learning and NLP by make a preprocessing by NLP then make a neural network that take the input and predict the probability of each tag then easily the chat bot choose random response based on the tag
the input of the model is the pattern after convert it to the bag of words . to improve the quality of this chat bot we can increase the tags and the patterns in the json file but it is demo of simple chat bot right now
